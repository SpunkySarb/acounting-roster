# The Roster -Synopsis (Sarbjeet Singh)

Developed an accounting systyem as mentiened.




## Frontend-React.js


I chose React framework for my frontend requirements because this application is being used by a company and there is no need for server-side-rendering.

## Backend- GraphQL

The application requirements were not so complex so I had no problem choosing either Express server for REST API or Apollo Server as GraphQL.
But I chose GraphQL because I wanted to try the Apollo library and my experience was great.
## Instructions

Accounting->Login-> Then you see the list of Artists

Payment Status Toggle button is under Payment Status Column for each row.

List is Searchable and is sorted as DESC order of Payment Amount.
